# The Great Vault
Get disappointed any time, not just on reset days.

## What
Web app that replicated functionality found in game World of Warcraft.

You do weekly tasks in-game, and every week you get rewarded with loot you can choose 
from.

The quality of items depends on how hard the finished tasks are.

## How
Built on React with huge help from https://www.wowhead.com/tooltips. Wowhead tooltips is a js library that provides on hover tooltips for ingame items, custom bonuses, levels etc.

There is no backend running as all data can be provided with website itself and no API calls or data processing is necessary. Also, server doesn't have to do anything other than serve built static website.

Good idea? No. Is it working? Kinda...

## Why
I wanted to dip my toes into react, and what better way to do so, than go ahead and build something.

This is my first react project so it's far from perfect.
