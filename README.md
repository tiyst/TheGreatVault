# The Great Vault
Get disappointed any time, not just on reset days.

Web app that replicated functionality found in game World of Warcraft.

You do weekly tasks in-game, and every week you get rewarded with loot you can choose 
from.
The quality of items depends on how hard the finished tasks are.

## Why?
I wanted to dip my toes into react, what better way to do so than go ahead and build something.

This is my first react project so far from perfect, and it shows.

## What have you done?!
There is no backend, everything is done in react on front end.

Good idea? No. Is it working? Kinda...
